# Ignore revisions in git blame - set your git config to use the file by convention:
# git config blame.ignoreRevsFile .git-blame-ignore-revs
#
# Optional additional git config:
# Mark any lines that have had a commit skipped using --ignore-rev with a `?`
# git config --global blame.markIgnoredLines true
# Mark any lines that were added in a skipped commit and can not be attributed with a `*`
# git config --global blame.markUnblamableLines true

# Convert to file-scoped namespaces.
